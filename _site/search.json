The Exit Form also records your certification as well as needed departmental approvals that you have satisfactorily completed your capstone requirements. This form must be executed before you will recieve credit for UP 591 which is required to graduate.\nThe MUP Portfolio provides a holistic summary of your professional capacities and vision for practice.\nThe MUP Poster summarizes one important work that reflects your professional identity.\nThe Capstone Manuscript exemplifies your work as a planning practitioner (in the case of the Workshop or Project options) or planning researcher (in the case of the Thesis option). Students completing the workshop option are assessed on their contributions as part of the UP 510 class. Project and Thesis manuscripts are evaluated respectively by the faculty project adviser or thesis committee.\n\nAs a department, we use these deliverables in three ways:\n\nTo celebrate and record your significant accomplishments during your time as a graduate student at Illinois.\nTo assess your capacity to apply key knowledge acquired as a Masters student to advanced practice.\nTo assess your learning in accordance with university and accreditation learning outcomes assessment requirements."

    "text": "The MUP capstone consists of a series of deliverables that provide MUP students with the opportunity to apply what they have learned through their courses and internships to a specific planning problem or issue, and therefore to demonstrate their professional competence to both the faculty, potential employers, and the public.\nThe MUP Program requires that all students preparing to graduate produce three main deliverables in partial fulfillment of graduation capstone requirements:\n\nA Signed Capstone Exit Form\nThe Final MUP Portfolio\nThe Final MUP Poster\nThe Capstone Manuscript (for project or thesis submissions)\n\n\n\nThese deliverables help to summarize your time and knowledge acquired in the MUP program.\n\nThe Capstone Exit Form records both information about your submissions as well as your permission for the library to publicly archive your capstone deliverables. The Exit Form also records your certification as well as needed departmental approvals that you have satisfactorily completed your capstone requirements. This form must be executed before you will recieve credit for UP 591 which is required to graduate.\nThe MUP Portfolio provides a holistic summary of your professional capacities and vision for practice.\nThe MUP Poster summarizes one important work that reflects your professional identity.\nThe Capstone Manuscript exemplifies your work as a planning practitioner (in the case of the Workshop or Project options) or planning researcher (in the case of the Thesis option). Students completing the workshop option are assessed on their contributions as part of the UP 510 class. Project and Thesis manuscripts are evaluated respectively by the faculty project adviser or thesis committee.\n\nAs a department, we use these deliverables in three ways:\n\nTo celebrate and record your significant accomplishments during your time as a graduate student at Illinois.\nTo assess your capacity to apply key knowledge acquired as a Masters student to advanced practice.\nTo assess your learning in accordance with university and accreditation learning outcomes assessment requirements."

Students wishing to pursue the Project Pathway or Thesis Pathway need to describe their projects and petition to adopt an alternate pathway.\nPlan Making Workshop: Exposure to professional planning practice by completing two plan making workshops. The audience for the projects completed in these workshops is typically planning and policy practitioners and decision makers. Faculty workshop leaders work in partnership with an institution, organization, or community partner to determine the scope and deliverables from the workshop in advance. Typical workshop deliverables may be a report, a plan, or other professional quality work.\nMaster’s Project: A professional project or analysis focusing on a topic relevant to the student’s selected concentration and career goals. The audience for a master’s project is typically planning and policy practitioners and decisionmakers. The capstone deliverable may be a report, a plan, or other professional quality work. The project is conducted for or with an external client.\nMasters Thesis: A scholarly applied or basic research work conducted under the formal Thesis Guidelines of the Department and Graduate College. The audience for a master’s thesis is typically academic and applied researchers. The thesis option is most appropriate for MUP students with a strong interest in pursuing a research-oriented career or PhD degree."

    "text": "Pathway Documentation\nOne of your first tasks is to “adopt” your capstone project. You will do this in the spring before your second year by completing the following form to indicate your capstone pathway and preferences regarding workshop offerings.\n\nUP 510 Workshop Descriptions\nYou will have four UP 510 Plan Making Workshop courses to choose from in your second year of the program. Most MUP students will elect to take two workshops, one in the fall semester, and one in the spring semester. Given the intensive nature of workshops, the department does not allow students to register for more than one UP 510 offering per semester.\nUnlike most of the other classes you take in our department, we will assign you to workshop courses taking into account your stated preferences as well as the unique demands of each workshop offering. You will complete the capstone adoption web form to share your preferences. The department will then assign and enroll you in fall and spring workshop offerings.\nBelow, are general descriptions of the UP 510: Plan Making Workshops being offered in Academic Year 2025-2026.\n\nRetrofitting Suburbia Using Small Area Plans (Fall 2025)\nInstructor: Dustin Allred\nSemester Offered: Fall 2025\nWorkshop External Partner: City of Bloomington, IL\nWorkshop Description: Like many cities in the US, the central Illinois city of Bloomington is interested in seeing the site of a dying mall rehabilitated through redevelopment. The 54 acre Eastland Mall is a strategically important site east of downtown Bloomington that presents an interesting opportunity to apply planning ideas like “retrofitting suburbia” in the creation of a small area plan that describes how this site can evolve into a more sustainable, just, healthy, and community-serving place. Although the city has some ideas for what could happen on this site, it would be up to the students in the workshop to engage with key stakeholders and collect and analyze data on existing conditions to create a compelling and feasible vision for how the site could be transformed.\nExpected Outputs: Outputs from this workshop will include a polished professional small area type plan that synthesizes stakeholder input and background information and includes a development concept, site plan and implementation strategies. Students will also be expected to present this information to decision makers at the City of Bloomington.\n\n\nClimate and Workforce Development (Fall 2025)\nInstructor: Marc Doussard\nSemester Offered: Fall 2025\nWorkshop External Partner: Illinois Climate Jobs Institute\nWorkshop Description: This workshop is a collaboration with the Climate Jobs Institute (CJI) in the School of Labor and Employment Relations. Established to provide research support the goals of the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, CJI is evaluating the impact of the political coalition who won support for the Act on the current development of climate-friendly (“green”) jobs. The process of making green jobs available and viable is complicated. It requires place-based networks of unions, community colleges, employers, not-for-profits and other key actors in the community and economic development process. Students in the workshop will investigate the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act’s transition from idea to reality, by evaluating the place-based networks of actors (unions, community colleges, employers, community organizations) attempting to make training programs for green jobs a reality. We will begin with background reading on green jobs and the alliances between unions and environmental organizations. The class will then assemble evidence on the effectiveness of green jobs programs elsewhere. Finally, students will use basic research methods for collecting secondary data and conducting interviews to provide an assessment of the status of green jobs programs across four Illinois cities. The results will aid CJI in supporting the development of the job-training networks whose effective operation is necessary for the law to reach its goals.\nExpected Outputs: At the workshop’s conclusion, you will produce a detailed, comparative study of climate-jobs political coalitions across key Illinois cities. The study will apply the political theories you learned to data on organizations active in climate jobs, and interviews to determine the current challenges facing the law’s implementation. You will conclude the course with experience evaluating how plans and policies are actually implemented.\n\n\nGlobal Urban Economic Development (Spring 2026)\nInstructor: Kerry Fang\nSemester Offered: Spring 2026\nWorkshop External Partner: Politecnico di Milano (Italy)\nWorkshop Description: This workshop is a two-campus collaboration between UIUC with Politecnico di Milano in Milan (Italy). It embraces urban economic development in a global setting, with a special focus on industrial clusters, urban creativity and innovation, and entrepreneurship. It offers a first-hand international planning experience in partnership with your Italian peers. In this workshop, we will learn theories, analytical methods, and development practices in a seminar- and discussion-based fashion from instructors and students from both campuses, introducing a wide range of global development approaches from first-hand experiences. More importantly, in this project-based class, we will team up with cross-continental peers to work on comparative projects, to explore effective ways of urban economic development, apply comprehensive methods to track the performance of different regions, and formulate policy recommendations to improve local development, create jobs, boost innovation, and prompt entrepreneurship.\nExpected Outputs: At the end of this workshop, you will produce an international comparative study in partnership with your peers from Politecnico di Milano. In this study, you will apply economic development theories and analysis tools to solve concrete planning problems in both domestic and international settings. You will also be able to formulate evidence-based policy recommendations and adapt them to different political settings.\n\n\nCentral Illinois Housing Needs Assessment (Spring 2026)\nInstructor: Andrew Greenlee\nSemester Offered: Spring 2026\nWorkshop External Partner: Illinois Housing Lab\nWorkshop Description: Central Illinois’ housing landscape is rapidly changing due to major changes in population as well as major changes in both state and federal housing policy. Many communities throughout the region lack the capacity to strategically understand local housing needs or to think systematically about how local needs fit into the broader regional housing landscape. To engage these issues, in this workshop we will conduct a regional housing needs assessment with the goal of both describing the evolving housing landscape present throughout central Illinois and then providing guidance on potential strategies to address identified needs.\nOver the course of this workshop, we will work with the Central Illinois Land Bank Authority and other housing agencies in central Illinois to analyze trends related to housing supply and demand, and to develop a broader understanding of institutional needs and goals related to housing. Students in this workshop will work with public and proprietary sources of housing and community demographic information to produce a regional picture of housing needs, and will also gain experience conducting interviews and facilitating conversations with local communities and institutions about housing and community change.\nExpected Outputs: Outputs from this workshop will include a polished professional report summarizing the process and findings from the needs assessment. As part of this needs assessment, secondary outputs will include a data dashboard for sharing information with local communities as well as an intervention toolkit that describes potential intervention strategies to address needs that are identified.\n\n\n\nAdditional Documentation for Projects and Theses\n\nFor the Project Pathway you need to share a detailed description of your projects subject and scope, a description of your client, and need to secure the signature of your client and the faculty member who has agreed to supervise your project.\nFor the Thesis Pathway you need to share a project abstract and need to secure the signature of your thesis advisor and a second faculty committee member. You should have also shared a detailed proposal with both your thesis adviser and your other committee member by the time you adopt your capstone."

You may choose which work completed during the MUP program which you want to showcase on your poster. For those students pursuing the Project or Thesis capstone pathways, you may choose to design a poster based upon your capstone deliverable, however, this is not required. Likewise, students who completed the workshop pathway may design a poster based upon their contributions to the overall workshop deliverable, however, the poster should focus on distinct individual contributions rather than on the overall workshop outputs. Individuals who completed a group project have the option of designing companion posters with one printed poster per group member.\nYou will recieve feedback on your draft poster during a poster markup event in April. You will print and display your final poster at the Planning at Illinois capstone reception in May.\n\n\nYour poster should be a polished and visually engaging summary of a key piece of work you completed as part of your MUP degree. All posters must meet the following requirements:\n\nThe printed poster should be 24” x 36” (portrait or landscape orientation).\nYour Name - Master of Urban Planning\nDepartment of Urban + Regional Planning\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\nThe semester in which you are graduating (e.g. Spring 2025)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour audience should quickly understand your story\nLiterature, history, and sources should be minimal\nIllustrate methods visually using process diagrams or flow charts instead of long narrative descriptions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe key is effective visual communication, not lengthy explanations\nVisuals (maps, charts, diagrams, images) should be approximately 3/4 of your poster with the remaining 1/4 text\nVisuals should be informative and self-explanatory, complementing each other to tell a compelling story.\nClear captions, annotations, and consistent labeling can help maintain focus on your story.\nConvert tables into charts and diagrams - visuals are faster to process and interpret.\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign with consistency: use grids, maintain alignment, and avoid crowding\nDevelop a visual hierarchy to establish priorities for your audience. Image size can help to reinforce this hierarchy with smaller visuals supporting secondary details.\n\nUse colors judiciously and purposefully\nYou are not limited to a white background + subtle textures, gradients, and muted images can add sophistication but should not overwhelm content.\nConsider color conventions (e.g., red = caution / danger / important; green = go / environment / good; blue = water / calm); if you include a plan map remember to use land use color conventions.\nOnline design tools can help you find ideal color combinations\nLimiting yourself to no more than 3-4 main colors generally makes it easier to create a cohesive and impactful visual that projects a professional and polished look.\n\nUse text sparingly\n\nEstablish a clear text hierarchy: main points (headlines), subheads, short supporting blurbs (captions, labels, annotations).\nUse bullets and sentence fragments rather than paragraphs.\nLimit wrapped text and long text blocks.\n\nUnderstand typeface selection and choose fonts with care\n\nTitle: Approximately 100 pt\nHeading: 60-70 pt\nBody test: 36-40 pt\nCaptions: 18-20 pt\n\nLimit yourself to 2-3 fonts for visual consistency\n\nOne font for titles and headings\nOne font for body text\nOne font (optional) for captions or annotations\n\nUse sans serif fonts for headlines (more modern and legible at large sizes)\nUse serif fonts for body text, especially at smaller sizes for readability\nIf using a colored background, choose high-contrast fonts (medium or bold weights work best)\nEmbrace white space to frame your content and improve readability. This includes negative space around all text and visual elements.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse color, font size, and positioning to guide the reader through your content in the intended order\nTwo effective layout strategies:\n\nColumn Layout (newspaper style) - 2-3 vertical columns read left to right and top to bottom\nCentral Focus (billboard style) - One bold central message with supporting visuals around it\n\nDirectional cues (arrows, numbering,subtle design elements) can help lead the eye\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can find examples of prior MUP posters through UIUC IDEALS"

According to the Code, “ignorance is no excuse.”\nTo meet this standard in this class, note the following: in written work, all ideas (as well as data or other information) that are not your own must be cited. Note that ideas that require citation may not have been published or written down anywhere. While you are free—and indeed encouraged—to discuss the assignments with your peers, all of your data collection, analysis, and writing should be your own. Sharing of data sources you have been assigned to collect is a violation of the honor code in this course. The penalty for failing to meet the principles or spirit of the honor code may include automatic failure of the assignment or the class, at the discretion of the instructor.\nThe Department of Urban and Regional Planning is committed to maintaining a learning environment that is rooted in the goals and responsibilities of professional planners. By enrolling in a class offered by the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, students agree to be responsible for maintaining an atmosphere of mutual respect in all activities, including lectures, discussions, labs, projects, and extracurricular programs. See Student Code Article 1-Student Rights and Responsibilities, Part 1. Student Rights: §1-102.\n\nHealth and Safety\nFollowing University policy, all students are required to engage in appropriate behavior to protect the health and safety of the community. If you feel ill, do not come to class. In addition, if you test positive for COVID-19 or have had an exposure that requires testing and/or quarantine, do not attend class. Please notify me, and at my discretion, you will be given excused absences for these class sessions. We will also develop a plan to discuss how to make up any missed work.\n\n\nStaying in Touch\nAs you learn and face challenges this semester, I need you to communicate with me, either during our course sessions or individually. You can schedule an appointment with me at your convenience via my Calendly page. I promise to listen, to be a resource, and to help in any way that I can - if I can’t help you, I will find someone who can.\n\n\nSexual Misconduct Reporting Obligation\nThe University of Illinois is committed to combating sexual misconduct. Faculty and staff members are required to report any instances of sexual misconduct to the University’s Title IX and Disability Office. In turn, an individual with the Title IX and Disability Office will provide information about rights and options, including accommodations, support services, the campus disciplinary process, and law enforcement options.\nA list of the designated University employees who, as counselors, confidential advisors, and medical professionals, do not have this reporting responsibility and can maintain confidentiality, can be found here. Other information about resources and reporting is available at wecare.illinois.edu.\n\n\nMental Health\nThe University of Illinois offers a variety of confidential services including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, psychiatric services, and specialized screenings which are covered through the Student Health Fee. If you or someone you know experiences mental health concerns, please contact or visit any of the University’s resources provided below. Getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do for yourself and for those who care about you.\n\nCounseling Center: (217) 333-3704\nMcKinley Health Center: (217) 333-2700\n988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline: (800) 273-8255\nRosecrance Crisis Line (217) 359-4141\n\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911."

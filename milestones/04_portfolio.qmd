## Milestone Description


## Milestone Deliverable

The MUP Portfolio is a holistic summary of your professional identity including polished examples that represent your practice as a planner. The professional portfolio should be designed to showcase your skills and tell a story of who you are as a professional planner. Show examples that you can tell stories about during an interview. Use the portfolio to communicate your design sense.

**Professional History and Goals** - Include a narrative description of your professional history which describes your professional goals and trajectory as well as your values as a professional. Include in your narrative statement a description of your professional goals for the five-year period after you complete your degree.

**Resume / CV** - Include an up to date version of your resume or curriculum vitae. 

**Statement of Impact** - Include a narrative statement describing your vision for the type of impact which you aspire to have in your area or field of work.

**Statement of Leadership** - Include a narrative statement describing your vision for leadership in your area or field of work.

**Work Samples** - Include work samples that best illustrate your professional trajectory and capabilities. Include work samples from your core courses, electives, internship (if applicable and you have permission), capstone, and any other contexts that are relevant.

You may choose the format for your portfolio - this could be an document intended for print, could be a website, or could take another format of your choice. You will need to provide a durable record which the department can evaluate. We also hope that this portfolio will be an important resource as you pursue your next professional or academic steps as you prepare to graduate.

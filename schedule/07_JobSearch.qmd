## Session Overview

Now that you are in the final semester of the MUP program, it's time to start thinking about your job search goals and strategy. While each of you have different needs and considerations to account for in your job searches, there's a range of strategies for tapping into your professional networks, responding to job ads, and creating visibility for your work that we'll review. We'll then work together to articulate individual strategies based upon your needs and goals.
